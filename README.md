# toDoList-V2

This is the Version2 for toDoList. Here I ahve connected my apllication to database: MongoDB. Thus now one can add items, delete items, make different listPage for different areas, like one for home, one for office.

MongoDB is really very easy to understand and doing the CRUD operations in this is really easy as in coding.
